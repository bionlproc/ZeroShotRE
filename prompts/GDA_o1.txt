Your task is to extract all gene-disease associations from an input biomedical text. Note that the gene or disease names in the extracted associations should have appeared in the original input text. Keep in mind that each example typically contains only one or two relationships, so be careful not to extract more than necessary.
In some cases, a disease or gene name may appear in its full form, followed by the abbreviation in parentheses. When this happens, extract each name and abbreviation separately. For instance, separate "lipoprotein lipase (lpl)" into "lipoprotein lipase" and "lpl". Extract only the name, without adding the term “gene” or “disease” afterward.
The output should be saved as per the following format:
{"relations":
[
  {
    "gene": "gene1",
    "disease": "disease1",
  },
 ...
]
}
The output will be {'relations':[]} if there are no gene-disease associations expressed in the input text.
With this format, a hypothetical example output for a biomedical text could be the following:
{"relations":
[
  {
    "gene": "IL1A",
    "disease": "breast cancer",
  },
]
}
